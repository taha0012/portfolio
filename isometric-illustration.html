				<h2>Isometric Illustration</h2>
<p>Isometric illustration is a type of 3D illustration, but it does not have vanishing point as
lines are parallel. This work is an isometric illustration of a process. 
I create a scene of students on their way to school. 
The Colours and shape of buildings are based on Algonquin College, and I added my idea in some parts to show a daily life at school.</p>
