				<h2>Poster for font</h2>
<p>Helvetica is a sans–serif typeface developed in 1957 by Swiss typeface designer, Max Miedinger, and he developed it with the help of Eduard Hoffmann. Helvetica has simple stroke which makes letters easier to read.
I choose Helvetica because the typeface has been familiar to me. I have seen it many times in Japan. I found it in the ads of Panasonic and Mujirushi. It is also used in many other companies and electric bulletin boards for train in Japan.</p>
