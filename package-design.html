				<h2>Package design</h2>
<p>I redesigned selection’s coffee whitener. The original package is a cylindrical form made of plastic with a photo of coffee and cookies, and its cover is red. 
I keep simplicity in mind. I use only brown and white because brown represents coffee and white represents whitener. There is a picture on it, and it shows a cup of coffee during whitener melting. 
The package I created has small packets of paper to separate whitener. By making a package in this way, it helps to reduce the use of whitener, and it is convenient to share it with others. Everything is made of paper which is easier to recycle.</p>
