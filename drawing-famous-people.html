				<h2>Drawing of a famous people</h2>
<p>I drew Albert Einstein who is a famous theoretical physicist. I examined his parts and draw them with straight lines and curve lines to create a characteristic appearance.
I use three colours, and I tint or tone with white and black to make more colours. Those colours harmonize very well, and dark colours create shadow and add depth to the illustration. </p>
