				<h2>Mio Tahara</h2>
            <p>Mio Tahara bore in Tokyo, Japan. She moved Canada in 2007. My hobby was to draw when I was little. My hobby does not change after I graduated high school, so I decided to take art course in Algonquin College. 
I have learned the basic skills for drawing, creating 3D objects, taking photos, adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, In design, etc.
I love to create things with various colours and shapes. I find myself happy in the process of creation, so I am very interested in having the opportunity to work in the art field.</p>
            <p>Japan consists of the four main islands of Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, along with a plethora of smaller islands, and is separated from the Asian mainland by the Sea of Japan and bordered on the east by the Pacific Ocean. Nearly 75 percent of the country's land surface is covered with mountains, and the climate, although generally humid, ranges from cool in the north to subtropical in the south.</p>
