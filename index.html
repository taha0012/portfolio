				<h2>About Mio Tahara</h2>
            <p>Bore in Tokyo, Japan and moved Canada in 2007. 
            I have learned the basic skills for drawing, creating 3D objects, taking photos, adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, In design, website coding, etc.
			I love to create things with various colours and shapes. I find myself happy in the process of creation, 
            so I am very interested in having the opportunity to work in the art field.</p>
