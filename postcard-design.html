				<h2>Postcard design</h2>
<p>I created an advertisement for Flexi Lexi. The copy of Flexi Lexi is “Just add spinach”. 
I picked up five fruits and took out original leaves of them and put spinach leaves. 
By using pink with gradation on the reverse side, it will guide readers’ eyes to the logo and information. 
I use a picture of an apple because it is used in their logo, and it fits as a representative of fruits. </p>
