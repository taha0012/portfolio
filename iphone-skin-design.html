				<h2>Summer Night(iPhone skin design)</h2>
<p>iPhone skin design is represented by an image of summer night. I have chosen it because I like Japanese summer. 
When I think of summer in Japan, I always remember goldfish vendors at a summer festival. 
Goldfish swam with bubbles pleasantly. Goldfish is also popular design for Yukata which is Japanese kimono in summer. 
The image of goldfish in water is often used on Yukata to create peaceful and cool atmosphere.</p>
<p>I drew two kinds of goldfish with ripples at the bottom and added cherry blossoms for Japanese taste. For texture, I chose it to emphasize Japanese taste as well.</p>
