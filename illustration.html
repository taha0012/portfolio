				<h2>Stylized illustration</h2>
<p>I draw this picture with a technique established by Yusuke Nakamura. 
This was the task that we picked up an illustrator and examined his/her technique and draw a picture using his/her technique. 
I tried to draw it with simplicity of design, which would tell us a lot of stories.</p>
<p>Done by Adobe Illustrator</p>
