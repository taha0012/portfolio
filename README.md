My hobby was to draw when I was little. But I didn't know that I am interested in designing. 

One day I realized that I see colours and design more than other people. My eyes catches colours and design even I am not ment to. When I realize that, I found that I love to see designs, colours, shape oll that designing stuffs. 
Because of that, I choose to enter Algonquin college.

After I entered to Algonquin college and start learning design, everything is very interesting to me.
